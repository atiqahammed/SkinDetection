# SkinDetection
This is an application of Naive Bayes algorithm. Naive Bayes is a well known classifier. I used it for detecting human skin from a picture file. The output of the code will be a picture in which the pixel with human skin will be represented by white color and non skin pixel will be represented by black color.
